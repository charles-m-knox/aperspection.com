&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2oPFRuPD6kXiMVO7QxIazB">Next&lt;/a> has reached the &amp;ldquo;1,000 plays&amp;rdquo; milestone some time over the last week or two, I suspect. It is
the second of my songs to hit this threshold on Spotify.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I was pleased that this song was gaining some traffic, and wondered what happened.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My &amp;ldquo;Spotify for Artists&amp;rdquo; dashboard shows a spike in about 623 plays on Friday, January 24, 2025. After that, it returned &lt;em>exactly&lt;/em> to the previous amount. It was an anomaly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I figured it was perhaps someone on a Twitch stream playing it and doing something akin to a Spotify Jam with many listeners. Perhaps most people might not like it, but it would explain a sudden burst with a decline back to normal stream counts.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="artificial-streams">Artificial streams&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Turns out, the traffic was probably fake. I received an email from my music distributing service provider today:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>ALERT: Your music has been removed from Spotify due to artificial streaming activity&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Spotify has detected that the majority of streams on some of your track(s) were artificial.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a result, the release(s) containing those track(s) have been removed from Spotify.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your music has not been removed from any other streaming service and is still live everywhere else where you&amp;rsquo;ve chosen to distribute it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a bummer to have this happen. I don&amp;rsquo;t care about getting rich off of my music, because my music isn&amp;rsquo;t really meant for the masses. I just upload it so that others might stumble upon something they enjoy every now and then.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d simply prefer to have the fraudulent activity erased from my stream history and simply not be paid for streams that aren&amp;rsquo;t real. Instead, I might have to re-upload tracks. All because of some random person or bot that decided to stream one of my songs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="is-it-worth-it">Is it worth it?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If this happens again, I might consider taking down my music. I pay a small fee every year to upload music to these platforms, and I have no interest in dealing with this.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Next - 1000 Plays</title><link>https://aperspection.com/next-1000/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2025 17:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aperspection.com/next-1000/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;del>&lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2oPFRuPD6kXiMVO7QxIazB">Next&lt;/a> has reached the &amp;ldquo;1,000 plays&amp;rdquo; milestone some time over the last week or two, I suspect.

&lt;p>&lt;del>Thanks to all of those who spent time listening to this song! Here are a few bits of info about the track that you might appreciate.&lt;/del>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Update 2025-01-30: &lt;a href="https://aperspection.com/next-1000-fakes/">Turns out, these plays were &amp;ldquo;artificial&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Space Code B - 1000 Plays</title><link>https://aperspection.com/space-code-b-1000/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2025 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aperspection.com/space-code-b-1000/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1zDoLjCqeNdlCi1vftSGg8">Space Code B&lt;/a> has reached the &amp;ldquo;1,000 plays&amp;rdquo; milestone as of late 2024, and currently sits at 1,327 plays as I post this. It is the first aperspection song to reach 1,000 plays.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All of the songs in the &lt;a href="https://aperspection.com/space-codes/">Space Codes&lt;/a> series help me stay focused when I&amp;rsquo;m grinding out certain tasks that require critical thought, such as programming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope all &amp;gt;1000 of those plays helped others do the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="composition">Composition&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Each of the Space Codes songs&amp;rsquo; composition is relatively simple - a few basic synths, a bassline, and then ambient sounds sprinkled in to create atmosphere. There&amp;rsquo;s really not much to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each of the synths and ambient sounds are slowly altered in intervals as the song progresses. Low and high-pass filters are modulated on low-frequency oscillators (LFOs) at varied intervals. This gives the song a sense of fluid continuity and mitigates the otherwise static nature of the same chords and notes being played repeatedly for an hour.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="production-notes">Production notes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Space Codes A, B, C, and D were created without using any 3rd party VSTs in FL Studio. All sounds are created using synthesizers and effects plugins that ship with the software suite.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No audio samples were used at all. The project file is self-contained and is highly portable between different systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The complexity in producing a Space Code track is low. It only took a handful of hours to create Space Code B, for example.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="interest">Interest&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you have any questions about Space Codes, feel free to &lt;a href="https://aperspection.com/contact/">reach out to me via the contact page&lt;/a>. I&amp;rsquo;d be happy to hear from you.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
