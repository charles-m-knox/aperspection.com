It is
the second of my songs to hit this threshold on Spotify.</p></blockquote><p>I was pleased that this song was gaining some traffic, and wondered what happened.</p><p>My &ldquo;Spotify for Artists&rdquo; dashboard shows a spike in about 623 plays on Friday, January 24, 2025. After that, it returned <em>exactly</em> to the previous amount. It was an anomaly.</p><p>I figured it was perhaps someone on a Twitch stream playing it and doing something akin to a Spotify Jam with many listeners. Perhaps most people might not like it, but it would explain a sudden burst with a decline back to normal stream counts.</p><h2 id=artificial-streams>Artificial streams</h2><p>Turns out, the traffic was probably fake. I received an email from my music distributing service provider today:</p><blockquote><p>ALERT: Your music has been removed from Spotify due to artificial streaming activity</p><p>Spotify has detected that the majority of streams on some of your track(s) were artificial.</p><p>As a result, the release(s) containing those track(s) have been removed from Spotify.</p><p>Your music has not been removed from any other streaming service and is still live everywhere else where you&rsquo;ve chosen to distribute it.</p></blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s a bummer to have this happen. I don&rsquo;t care about getting rich off of my music, because my music isn&rsquo;t really meant for the masses. I just upload it so that others might stumble upon something they enjoy every now and then.</p><p>I&rsquo;d simply prefer to have the fraudulent activity erased from my stream history and simply not be paid for streams that aren&rsquo;t real. Instead, I might have to re-upload tracks. All because of some random person or bot that decided to stream one of my songs.</p><h2 id=is-it-worth-it>Is it worth it?</h2><p>If this happens again, I might consider taking down my music. I pay a small fee every year to upload music to these platforms, and I have no interest in dealing with this.</p></section></article><hr><nav class="align-left mb-3"><a href=/ rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target=_self>Home</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;
