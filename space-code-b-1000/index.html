It is the first aperspection song to reach 1,000 plays.</p><p>All of the songs in the <a href=/space-codes/>Space Codes</a> series help me stay focused when I&rsquo;m grinding out certain tasks that require critical thought, such as programming.</p><p>I hope all >1000 of those plays helped others do the same.</p><h2 id=composition>Composition</h2><p>Each of the Space Codes songs&rsquo; composition is relatively simple - a few basic synths, a bassline, and then ambient sounds sprinkled in to create atmosphere. There&rsquo;s really not much to it.</p><p>Each of the synths and ambient sounds are slowly altered in intervals as the song progresses. Low and high-pass filters are modulated on low-frequency oscillators (LFOs) at varied intervals. This gives the song a sense of fluid continuity and mitigates the otherwise static nature of the same chords and notes being played repeatedly for an hour.</p><h2 id=production-notes>Production notes</h2><p>Space Codes A, B, C, and D were created without using any 3rd party VSTs in FL Studio. All sounds are created using synthesizers and effects plugins that ship with the software suite.</p><p>No audio samples were used at all. The project file is self-contained and is highly portable between different systems.</p><p>The complexity in producing a Space Code track is low. It only took a handful of hours to create Space Code B, for example.</p><h2 id=interest>Interest</h2><p>If you have any questions about Space Codes, feel free to <a href=/contact/>reach out to me via the contact page</a>. I&rsquo;d be happy to hear from you.</p></section></article><hr><nav class="align-left mb-3"><a href=/ rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target=_self>Home</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;
