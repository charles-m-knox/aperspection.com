I don&rsquo;t care enough about making money off my music - I didn&rsquo;t really put a significant amount of effort into making it perfect. It was more of a fun hobby.</p><p>Ultimately, I just put up my music so I can sometimes share it with people that might like it. Having music on Spotify (and other platforms) is convenient. I have always lost a tiny amount of money each year just to have the music available on these platforms.</p><h2 id=restoring-the-album-that-got-taken-down>Restoring the album that got taken down</h2><p>In order to restore the album on Spotify, it has to be re-uploaded as a brand new release.</p><p>The process for uploading an album is time-consuming, and making mistakes can be even more time-consuming to fix, partly due to the permanence of the fingerprinting system that distributors and streaming platforms use. Fixing metadata for a previously fingerprinted song can take days.</p><p>I am not interested in doing all this work. My assumption is that it was probably easy for whoever did this to do it again, so it seems like it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before another one of my tracks/albums gets taken down.</p><h2 id=next-steps>Next steps</h2><p>Simply put, I will not be <em>spending</em> any more money (and time) to deal with all this. My music will likely be disappearing from all platforms soon, if it hasn&rsquo;t happened already.</p><p>I am considering giving my music away for free with a relatively permissive or flexible license. Or perhaps a different platform. I&rsquo;m not sure yet.</p><p>The biggest loss here is for my <a href=/space-codes/>Space Codes</a> series. I think that it managed to find a small but genuine audience. I have a few ideas for keeping it around, but for now its fate is the same as all my other music and I&rsquo;ll be thinking about what to do.</p><h2 id=reach-out-if-this-impacts-you>Reach out if this impacts you</h2><p>If my music being unavailable on all the various streaming platforms has impacted you, <a href=/contact/>please reach out to me at the contact page</a> and I&rsquo;ll try and make it right for you.</p></section></article><hr><nav class="align-left mb-3"><a href=/ rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target=_self>Home</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;
