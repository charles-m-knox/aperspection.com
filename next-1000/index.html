It is the second of my songs to hit this threshold on Spotify.</p><p>Thanks to all of those who spent time listening to this song! Here are a few bits of info about the track that you might appreciate.</p><h2 id=production-statistics>Production statistics</h2><p>The song was started on October 31st, 2012. It was last modified on December 15, 2012.</p><p>The total time spent on it was 16 hours.</p><p>Other stats:</p><ul><li>Plugins: 122</li><li>Channels: 73</li><li>Mixer tracks: 30</li></ul><p>This song had a few different rhythms/melodies/variants before settling on the version you hear today. In FL Studio, the project has a bunch of extra unused content that didn&rsquo;t make the cut. This explains the high number of plugins/channels/tracks mentioned above.</p><h2 id=production-notes>Production notes</h2><p>I sometimes worked on this song while riding the bus.</p><p>In a few of my songs, I like to use open hi-hats on each quarter note, synchronized with the kick. This track does it well.</p><p>This song makes extensive use of an old, 32-bit FL Studio VST plugin called Wasp. It&rsquo;s responsible for most of the synthesized sounds.</p><p>I used Wasp for many of my songs made in the same 2010-ish timeframe like <a href=/oceana/>Oceana</a> and Next - it had a unique white noise modulator that added a breathy tone to the synth that I loved, and I used it liberally.</p><p>Unfortunately, I can no longer play the song in modern FL Studio versions because Wasp was never ported to 64 bit.</p><p>I consider Harmless to be the successor to Wasp (in FL Studio&rsquo;s suite of VST plugins), and I have found that it just can&rsquo;t produce the same sounds. Harmor is an option, but the major advantage of Wasp and Harmless is that both plugins have a streamlined user experience.</p><p>So, consider Next a tribute to Wasp, if nothing else&mldr; and consider it an entry in my list of songs that are defined by open hi-hats on quarter notes.</p><h2 id=interest>Interest</h2><p>If you have any questions about Next, feel free to <a href=/contact/>reach out to me via the contact page</a>. I&rsquo;d be happy to hear from you.</p></section></article><hr><nav class="align-left mb-3"><a href=/ rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target=_self>Home</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;
