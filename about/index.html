            <p>Aperspection is a solo music act based in the USA, active since around 2010. Here&rsquo;s all you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>I use FL Studio to make music on Linux, via <a href="https://usebottles.com/">Bottles</a>. I used to use Windows.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t take my music too seriously - it&rsquo;s a passive hobby. I explore different genres and moods.</li>
<li>All music is mixed and mastered by me - I do not pass my music through any third parties (for better or worse - some tracks could probably really have used some help).</li>
<li>I often make multiple edits to the same track, and upload them all, so that you can explore and enjoy different takes for yourself.</li>
<li>Aperspection stands for &ldquo;A perspective reflection&rdquo;. The music was always intended to reflect how I was feeling at the time of creation.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t sing (as of writing this), but I have provided ambient vocals for at least a few of my released songs.</li>
<li>Some songs may only be available on SoundCloud because I do not own a license to monetize some vocals, etc.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t go out of my way to market my music. Feel free to share it with anyone that you think might like it.</li>
<li>If I make a single track that makes you feel a specific mood that you enjoy, I&rsquo;ve accomplished my goal.</li>
</ul>
