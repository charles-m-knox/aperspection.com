Here&rsquo;s all you need to know.</p><p>I use FL Studio to make music on Linux, via <a href=https://usebottles.com/>Bottles</a>. I used to use Windows.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t take my music too seriously - it&rsquo;s a passive hobby. I explore different genres and moods.</p><p>All music is mixed and mastered by me - I do not pass my music through any third parties (for better or worse - some tracks could probably really have used some help).</p><p>I often make multiple edits to the same track, and upload them all, so that you can explore and enjoy different takes for yourself.</p><p>Aperspection stands for &ldquo;A perspective reflection&rdquo;. The music was always intended to reflect how I was feeling at the time of creation.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t sing (as of writing this), but I have provided ambient vocals for at least a few of my released songs.</p><p>Some songs may only be available on SoundCloud because I do not own a license to monetize some vocals, etc.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t go out of my way to market my music. Feel free to share it with anyone that you think might like it.</p><p>If I make a single track that makes you feel a specific mood that you enjoy, I&rsquo;ve accomplished my goal.</p></section></article><hr><nav class="align-left mb-3"><a href=/ rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target=_self>Home</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;
